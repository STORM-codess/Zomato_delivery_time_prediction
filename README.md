## Features

- **Real-time Prediction:** Get an estimated delivery time in **hours and minutes** based on your inputs.
- **Interactive UI:** Use sliders and number inputs to set feature values.
- **Feature Impact Analysis:** Interactive charts show how changes in one feature affect delivery time while others are held constant.
- **Modular Codebase:** Clean separation between user interface, model handling, and plotting logic.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Core programming language.
- **Streamlit:** For building the interactive web app.
- **Scikit-learn:** For using the Random Forest Regressor model.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and DataFrame creation.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
- **Joblib:** For loading the pre-trained `.pkl` model.
- **Altair:** For declarative and interactive visualizations.
